The project is from Maven's Healthcare Challenge [here](https://mavenanalytics.io/challenges/maven-healthcare-challenge/26) conducted in September 2023. The dataset was obtained in CSV format from Maven's website. If you have any comments or questions, please feel free to reach out.

## Background
I played the role of a Data Analyst for the American Hospital Association (AHA), a national organization that represents hospitals and their patients, and acts as a source of information on health care issues and trends. As part of my role, I've been asked to analyze the Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (HCAHPS) survey results for the last 9 years. The HCAHPS initiative intends to provide a standardized survey instrument for measuring patientsâ€™ perspectives on hospital care, and one of its 3 main goals is to "create incentives for hospitals to improve their quality of care

## Task
My task is to evaluate whether the HCAHPS survey has been successful in accomplishing this goal by answering questions like these:
- Have hospitals' HCAHPS scores improved over the past 9 years?
- Are there any specific areas where hospitals have made more progress than others?
- Are there any major areas of opportunity remaining?
- What recommendations can you make to hospitals to help them further improve the patient experience?

## Analysis
The data included several separate datasets such as the national results, state results, and response rates of the HCAHPS survey. All data were cleaned and filtered for any errors I might encountered.
The measures for the survey are:
- H_Comp_1 Communication with nurses
- H_Comp_2 Communication with doctors
- H_Comp_3: Responsiveness of hospital staff
- H_Comp_5: Communication about medicines
- H_Comp_6: Discharge information
- H_Comp_7: Care transition
- H_Clean_HSP: Cleanliness of hospital environment
- H_Quiet_HSP: Quietness of the hospital environment
- H_HSP_Rating: Overall hospital rating
- H_RECMND: Willingness to recommend hospital

## Insights
- As part of the Maven Healthcare Challenge, I delved deep into the Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (HCAHPS) survey data, a treasure trove of insights into the patient experience. Here's what I found:

- Continuous Improvement: Over the past nine years, HCAHPS scores have been on a consistent upward trajectory until 2021 when it begins to go downward. Hospitals across the nation have demonstrated a commitment to enhancing patient experiences.

- Notable Progress: The journey toward better healthcare is marked by remarkable progress. Patients' satisfaction scores have seen substantial boosts, particularly in areas like Communications with Doctors/Nurses and Discharge information. This is a testament to the dedication of healthcare providers.

- Untapped Potential: While progress is evident, there's still untapped potential. My analysis identifies specific areas where further enhancements can elevate the patient experience to even greater heights
